# ductwork
a utility for flow-based programming

Ductwork aims to provide on POSIX systems the same functionality
as CMS Pipelines provides on IBM mainframe systems CMS and TSO.

## ductwork

Too many things refer to pipelines, so "ductwork" is hoped to convey
the same idea. If that doesn't work, maybe we'll call this thing "plenum".
